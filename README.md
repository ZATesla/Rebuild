# **Flow Builder & Executor**

## **1\. Overview**

Flow Builder is a powerful tool designed to empower users to create and customize dynamic workflows (or "flows") through a visual interface. These flows consist of a series of configurable steps that can capture user input, execute custom logic, interact with external APIs, and guide end-users through a predefined process.

Once a flow is designed and published using the Flow Builder, it can be deployed and executed within a target web application (the "Executor"). This allows non-technical users or business analysts to define complex operational procedures or data capture sequences without writing code directly, while developers can extend the system with custom step functionalities.

The primary goal is to bridge the gap between business process definition and technical implementation, enabling rapid development and deployment of interactive, step-based applications.

## **2\. Core Concepts**

* **Flow:** A sequence of connected Steps designed to achieve a specific outcome. Flows are created and configured in the Flow Builder.  
* **Step:** An individual unit within a Flow. Each Step represents a specific action or interaction.  
  * **Type:** Defines the nature of the step (e.g., User Input, API Call, Conditional Logic).  
  * **Configuration:** Specific parameters for the step (e.g., for a User Input step, this would include field type, label, validation rules; for an API call, it would include endpoint, method, payload mapping).  
  * **Custom Code Hook:** An optional script or function that can be associated with a step to perform custom logic before, during, or after the step's execution.  
* **Flow Builder:** The visual design tool used to create, configure, and manage Flows. It allows users to:  
  * Add, remove, and reorder Steps.  
  * Define connections and transitions between Steps.  
  * Configure the properties of each Step.  
  * Manage versions of Flows.  
  * Publish Flows for execution.  
* **Flow Executor:** The runtime environment (typically a component within a web application) that interprets a published Flow definition and presents it to an end-user. It handles:  
  * Rendering the UI for user interaction steps.  
  * Executing API calls and custom code.  
  * Managing the state of the flow (data captured so far).  
  * Navigating the user through the flow based on step outcomes and connections.  
* **Flow Data Context:** A data object that persists throughout the execution of a flow. It stores information captured in previous steps and can be used to populate subsequent steps or API call payloads.

## **3\. Project Objectives**

* **No-Code/Low-Code Configuration:** Enable users to build complex workflows with minimal to no programming.  
* **Extensibility:** Allow developers to create custom step types and integrate custom JavaScript/backend logic.  
* **Dynamic User Interaction:** Support various user input types (text, numbers, dates, dropdowns, file uploads, etc.).  
* **API Integration:** Seamlessly integrate with external systems via RESTful APIs or other web services.  
* **Conditional Logic:** Allow flows to branch based on user input or API responses.  
* **State Management:** Maintain the context and data across different steps of a flow.  
* **Reusability:** Enable the creation of modular and reusable flow components or sub-flows (future).  
* **Clear Separation:** Maintain a clear distinction between the flow design environment (Flow Builder) and the flow execution environment (Executor).

## **4\. Features**

### **4.1. Flow Builder Features**

* **Visual Canvas:** Drag-and-drop interface for adding and arranging steps.  
* **Step Palette:** A library of predefined and custom step types.  
* **Step Configuration Panel:** Intuitive UI for setting up parameters for each selected step.  
  * Input field configuration (label, type, placeholder, required, validation rules).  
  * API call configuration (URL, method, headers, request body mapping from flow data context, response mapping to flow data context).  
  * Conditional logic builder.  
* **Connection Management:** Define transitions between steps, including conditional paths.  
* **Data Mapping:** Ability to map data from previous steps or the global flow context to current step inputs or API request payloads.  
* **Custom Code Editor (Basic):** A simple editor to attach JavaScript snippets to steps for custom logic (e.g., data transformation, complex validation).  
* **Flow Validation:** Check for completeness and logical errors in the flow design.  
* **Versioning & Publishing:** Save different versions of flows and publish specific versions for execution.  
* **Import/Export:** Ability to export flow definitions (e.g., as JSON) and import them.

### **4.2. Flow Executor Features**

* **Dynamic UI Rendering:** Renders appropriate UI elements for user input steps based on the flow definition.  
* **Step-by-Step Navigation:** Guides the end-user through the flow.  
* **Data** Collection & Context **Management:** Collects user inputs and maintains the flow data context.  
* **API Call Execution:** Securely executes configured API calls, handling request/response transformations.  
* **Custom Code Execution:** Runs associated JavaScript code for steps within a sandboxed environment.  
* **Error Handling:** Manages errors gracefully during flow execution (e.g., API failures, validation errors).  
* **Progress Indication:** Shows the user their current position within the flow.  
* **Resumability (Future):** Allow users to pause and resume flows.

## **5\. Step Types (Examples)**

* **User Input Steps:**  
  * TextInput: For short text entries.  
  * TextArea: For longer text entries.  
  * NumberInput: For numerical entries.  
  * DateSelector: For picking dates.  
  * DropdownSelect: For selecting a value from a predefined list (static or dynamically fetched).  
  * FileUpload: For uploading files.  
  * InformationDisplay: To show static text or rich content to the user.  
* **Logic & Processing Steps:**  
  * APICall: To make a request to an external API.  
    * Configuration: HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), URL, headers, request body (can use variables from flow context), response mapping (extract data from response into flow context).  
  * ConditionalBranch: To route the flow based on conditions (e.g., if userData.age \> 18).  
  * CustomCode: Execute a block of custom JavaScript code (can interact with the flow data context).  
  * SetVariable: To create or modify variables within the flow data context.  
* **Integration Steps (Examples):**  
  * ERPUpdate: A specialized API call step pre-configured for a specific ERP system.  
  * EmailNotification: Send an email.

## **6\. Architecture (High-Level)**

A potential architecture could involve:

* **Flow Builder (Frontend Application):**  
  * Likely a Single Page Application (SPA) using a framework like React, Vue, or Angular.  
  * Visual diagramming library (e.g., React Flow, JointJS, GoJS) for the canvas.  
  * Communicates with a Backend API to save/load flow definitions.  
* **Backend API (Service Layer):**  
  * Manages storage and retrieval of flow definitions (e.g., in a NoSQL or relational database).  
  * Handles authentication and authorization for accessing/modifying flows.  
  * Could potentially provide an endpoint for the Executor to fetch published flow definitions.  
  * Might include a secure execution environment or broker for server-side custom code or sensitive API calls.  
* **Flow Executor (Embeddable Component / Frontend Library):**  
  * Can be a JavaScript library or component integrated into the target web application.  
  * Fetches the flow definition (JSON).  
  * Interprets the definition to render UI and manage flow progression.  
* **Database:**  
  * To store flow definitions, versions, and potentially audit logs of flow executions.
